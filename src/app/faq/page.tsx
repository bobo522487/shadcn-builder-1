  // General Questions
  {
    id: "what-is-builder",
    question: "What is shadcn/ui Builder?",
    answer: "shadcn/ui Builder is a visual form builder that allows you to create beautiful, responsive forms using drag-and-drop functionality. It generates clean React code with TypeScript, uses shadcn/ui components, and includes built-in validation with React Hook Form and Zod.",
    category: "general",
    tags: ["overview", "form builder", "react"]
  },
  {
    id: "who-for",
    question: "Who is this tool designed for?",
    answer: "This tool is perfect for developers who want to speed up form creation, designers who need to prototype quickly, and anyone who wants to build professional forms without writing code from scratch. It's especially useful for React developers familiar with modern web development practices.",
    category: "general",
    tags: ["target audience", "developers", "designers"]
  },
  {
    id: "no-coding-required",
    question: "Do I need to know how to code to use this?",
    answer: "While coding knowledge isn't required to build forms visually, having basic understanding of web development helps. The tool generates React/TypeScript code, so if you want to customize or integrate the generated code, some programming knowledge is beneficial.",
    category: "general",
    tags: ["no-code", "coding", "requirements"]
  },
  {
    id: "browser-support",
    question: "Which browsers are supported?",
    answer: "The builder works on all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. We recommend using the latest version of your preferred browser for the best experience.",
    category: "general",
    tags: ["browser", "compatibility", "support"]
  },
  {
    id: "mobile-friendly",
    question: "Can I use the builder on mobile devices?",
    answer: "While the builder interface is optimized for desktop use, the forms you create are fully responsive and work perfectly on all devices. For the best building experience, we recommend using a desktop or tablet.",
    category: "general",
    tags: ["mobile", "responsive", "devices"]
  },

  // Technical Questions
  {
    id: "tech-stack",
    question: "What technologies does the builder use?",
    answer: "The builder is built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. Generated forms use React Hook Form for form handling and Zod for validation. All code follows modern React best practices.",
    category: "technical",
    tags: ["tech stack", "react", "nextjs", "typescript"]
  },
  {
    id: "code-quality",
    question: "What does the generated code look like?",
    answer: "The generated code is clean, readable, and production-ready. It includes proper TypeScript types, follows React best practices, uses semantic HTML, and includes accessibility features. You can copy and paste it directly into your project.",
    category: "technical",
    tags: ["code generation", "quality", "typescript"]
  },
  {
    id: "customization",
    question: "Can I customize the generated code?",
    answer: "Absolutely! The generated code is standard React/TypeScript that you can modify as needed. You can adjust styling, add custom validation, integrate with your backend, or extend functionality while maintaining the core structure.",
    category: "technical",
    tags: ["customization", "modification", "flexibility"]
  },
  {
    id: "integration",
    question: "How do I integrate forms into my existing project?",
    answer: "Simply copy the generated React component code and paste it into your project. Make sure you have the required dependencies (React Hook Form, Zod, shadcn/ui components) installed. The forms work with any React-based framework.",
    category: "technical",
    tags: ["integration", "existing project", "dependencies"]
  },
  {
    id: "validation",
    question: "How does form validation work?",
    answer: "Forms use Zod for schema validation and React Hook Form for form state management. You can set validation rules like required fields, min/max length, email format, and custom patterns directly in the builder interface.",
    category: "technical",
    tags: ["validation", "zod", "react hook form"]
  },

  // Features Questions
  {
    id: "available-components",
    question: "What form components are available?",
    answer: "The builder includes text inputs, textareas, selects, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers, file uploads, switches, and buttons. We also have content components like rich text blocks. New components are added regularly based on user feedback.",
    category: "features",
    tags: ["components", "inputs", "form fields"]
  },
  {
    id: "templates",
    question: "Are there pre-built form templates?",
    answer: "Yes! We provide templates for common use cases like contact forms, registration forms, surveys, feedback forms, and more. Templates are organized by category (business, healthcare, education, etc.) and can be customized to your needs.",
    category: "features",
    tags: ["templates", "pre-built", "examples"]
  },
  {
    id: "drag-drop",
    question: "How does the drag-and-drop interface work?",
    answer: "Simply drag components from the sidebar and drop them onto the canvas. You can reorder elements, nest components in containers, and adjust layouts visually. The interface provides real-time preview of your form as you build it.",
    category: "features",
    tags: ["drag and drop", "interface", "visual builder"]
  },
  {
    id: "responsive-design",
    question: "Are the generated forms responsive?",
    answer: "Yes! All forms are built with responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS. Forms automatically adapt to different screen sizes and look great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.",
    category: "features",
    tags: ["responsive", "mobile", "tailwind css"]
  },
  {
    id: "styling-options",
    question: "Can I customize the styling and appearance?",
    answer: "The builder offers various styling options including different variants, sizes, layouts, and spacing. Since it uses Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, you can further customize the appearance by modifying the generated code.",
    category: "features",
    tags: ["styling", "customization", "appearance"]
  },

  // Pricing Questions
  {
    id: "free-to-use",
